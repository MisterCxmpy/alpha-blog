# **Blog Application**

This application was created using:

- [Ruby v2.7.2](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.2/)
- [Rails v6.0.6](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v6.0/)
- [Bootstrap v4.4.1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/)

### **What does the app include?**
The purpose of the application is to allow users to create blog posts or articles.
Users will have the ability to view, edit and delete their posts.
All of the posts are stored in a database.
The users will have the ability to create an account - which must be done in order to create a post. Although this feature is still in development.

### **What am I currently working on?**
I am at a point where I think the project is complete. If I have any more ideas I may add them further on down the line.

### **Motiviation**
This is my first major Ruby project, at the time of creating this project I have a few months of experience using Ruby.
My experience so far has been extremely positive and I am looking forward to using more Ruby in my projects.
